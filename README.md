## Objectives :
__1. Write an application to analyze the sensitive data that is sent to applications when
using SSO__

## Theory :
Using SSO in your application represents a secure alternative to classical authentication using
login + passwords. On one hand it makes the life of the user much easier because they don’t need
to remember yet another password. On the other hand, the security savvy users can get worried
about what data is sent when using such logging systems. 

## Implementation :
The application:
• Offer user authentication via SSO using at least 3 identity providers (e.g. Facebook,
Gmail, Github);
• Configure SSO integration to get as much as possible data about the end-user;
• Output all data which was provided by the identity providers (e.g. user’s name, age,
gender, email etc.).

## Used technology :
Java
